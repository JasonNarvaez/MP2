This program implements a memory allocator based on the "buddy system". Here we provide our own definition of the unix calls "malloc()" and "free()" as "my_malloc()" and "my_free()". We use these definitions to run the ackermann function. However, ackermann currently only supports ackermann(1,1) and crashes for further cases.
